Hello and welcome to my first webpage. My name is Mojibola Olalekan from Nigeria, Lagos. This article is just to tell you my audience about the “Grit” concept, its value and importance and how my personal journey has reflected the concept and the value of <b>“Grit”.</b>

 </p>

<h4>     					<b>MY JOURNEY TO NOW</b>     </h4>

<p>
I, who had been very sick as a little child. My parents had done all they could to make me better all to no avail and after exhausting all options, I found myself at the doorstep of my grandma, to live with her for a long time to see if the health status would improve. She is a devoted christian and she forsook the modern treatment which my parents had tried before then and took me to the religious “treatment” she believed in and by the grace of<b> God</b> and as the religious ‘sect’ would say, I was ‘miraculously’ made well. 
 </p>

<p>
My then poor health excluded me from my family; my parents and siblings. I was living alone just with my grandma and an uncle of mine, no one to talk to, finding myself in a strange environment that dawned on me. 
</p>

<p>
I began settling in after some months, getting acclimated to my new environment and fast forwarding to a year, I was enrolled in a nursery school. Throughout my nursery going to primary school days, I would say I was a little bit above average in terms of class assessment; tests and exams. 
</p>


<p>
Now, I found myself in junior secondary classes after graduating out of primary school, not with ‘flying colours’. My junior secondary classes grades were also above average exploring the convenient position between 12th and 15th in the class of 30 students. 
</p>

<p>
Graduated the junior classes and<b> yay I’m a senior!</b> 
</p>

<p>
Now came this fateful day, it was the day a turn around occurred to my mindset, the way i think, it was the <b>“prize giving day”</b> or as my school would call it <b>“the valedictory service”</b> or as most people know it as <b>“the end of year party”</b>
</p>

<p>	
	<b>What happened on this day?</b>
</p>

<p>
I witnessed my close friends being called out to receive awards and prizes with the DJ playing the <b>“stand-up for the champion song”</b> as they come out at the presence of vast spectators including the parents and guardians of the students of the school and onlooking passersby and there i was fighting for the rice and drink being shared by the teachers at the back of the student stand and cloud of shame hovered over me at that particular moment. I saw myself as a failure. The memory of being alone, excluded from my family seeped back into my thoughts and reflected on that present moment making me feel excluded from my book-smart and intelligent peers. It was that at moment i determined to be among the recipients of the prize and award of the next year’s session, walking home with a grievous heart, almost tearful eyes and with nothing but that determination in my heart
</p>

<p>
	<b>What did i do after i got home?</b>
</p>

<p>
Well, you my curious reader would think i will get home and do nothing but start reading my books and engaged in everything academics so as to improve my grades and achieve my goals of getting the prize for being the best in my class the following year but I went home and hungrily consumed the “take-away” of rice which was given to all the students, after that, I resumed to my playing mode with no ounce of the thought of opening my book or any book at all.
</p>

<p>
	<b>The intervention:</b>
</p>

<p>
If you were following me from the beginning, you would know I told you I was living with my grandma and an uncle of mine. Now, this uncle of mine, he may not know it but he’s the major motivator behind my changed mindset. This uncle of mine is a very strict individual, he’s strict to the core. He saw me playing one day and then his attitude changed towards me. I don’t know if he felt I'm old enough to be disciplined and it’s time I got serious, but anyway, he dragged me inside, he flogged me to his heart's content while placing emphasis on me being too playful, my grades being too poor to his standard. 
</p>

<p>
The first term came and ended, I checked my grades and I realized there was no getting any prize at the end of the year. As I walked home with this thought, I met my uncle who was the only one at home and he also confirmed my grades burst into fits of anger and I was flogged more than before with no one to come to my rescue.
</p>

<p>
The second term came and ended, the result was just a teed better than the last and as the universe would have it, my uncle was the only one at home that day as well and I was flogged but the flogging was expectedly shorter than the last.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Rekindled determination:</b>
</p>

<p>
I definitely am not a fan of my uncle and neither is his way of disciplining but I had vowed to do everything and anything to avoid his flogging and therefore, I stopped playing, started spending more time on books and voila the third term ended and my grades came out as 5th. I jumped up with joy, ran home which was unusual of me and when my uncle asked for me to show him my grades, i handed it over without hesitation and i avoided his flogging that day. From that day forward, i started spending more time on my books and even pleaded to go for an extra tutorial classes. Then promoted to the next class and the first term ended, i was in the third position, my hunger to be the first deepened, i improved my involvement with books and that’s how i began being at the top of my class and gaining recognition among the teachers and fast forwarded to the next two<b> prize giving day</b>, i was called out with the DJ playing the<b> “stand-up for the champion”</b> song as i came forward with pride.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Now;</b>
</p>

<p>
I recently developed interest in tech, software engineering with the goal and dedication of developing a globally recognized and successful software solving a problem with Africa as my target and to the world. With my installed mindset of setting out my goals and doing everything in my power to achieve them, i started reading anything tech related, started following and connecting with established individuals in tech on linkedin and twitter and in the process, i found myself on the page of opportunity to be enrolled into the ALX software engineering program. I was sent an email with my acceptance letter and I jumped up with joy and I know that the path to achieving my goal is smoother than I had begun. 
</p>

<p>
	<b>What is this mindset of mine?</b>
</p>

<p>
GRIT! And this mindset is installed in me and it’ll continue to exist in me as i regularly update and upgrade this installed mindset.
Now, let’s talk about grit.
</p>

		              <h4> <b>UNDERSTANDING GRIT</b>  </h4>
<p>
We frequently get caught up in the web of obstacles and failures when pursuing achievement. Talent and skills unquestionably play a part, but grit stands out as the underlying force of transformation. I want you to explore the idea, value, and unwavering significance of grit as  illustrated by my personal experience in this voyage into the world of tenacity. Prepare to be motivated and given knowledge that will certainly change the way you view achieving greatness.
</p>

<p>
Grit is like a super strong determination that helps you achieve big goals even when things get tough. It's like mixing your strong feelings, not giving up, and trying really hard, which helps you do even more than you thought you could. Looking at my own experiences, I learned that being really good at something is great, but having grit is what stops good things from going away. Imagine when problems look really big and you're not sure where to go – having <b>grit</b> means you keep going because you really want to reach your big goal.
</p>

<h4>				<b>A VALUE BEYOND MEASURE</b></h4>


<p>   

Imagine this: two people start on the same mission. One is really good at it, but they give up easily when things get hard. The other person might not be as naturally good, but they have this special thing called grit. Grit means they don't give up, no matter how tough things get. So, who do you think will do better? It's pretty clear. Grit is like magic that changes problems into chances to do better. It's like a secret power that makes someone amazing instead of just good. It is what distinguishes the good from the great. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos' “never give up” mindset got them to build their present multi-billion dollar industry from just a small rented room as their office. In fact, there are countless success stories of great and famous individuals out there who have the grit mindset and which is the major plot behind their success story like the major ingredient in a delicacy.

</p>

<h4>				<b>THE GRIT-GROWTH SYMBIOSIS</b></h4>


<p>
One super cool thing about<b> grit</b> is how it's like a team player with <b>growing stronger.</b> When we face hard things and don't give up, it's like our bravery gets even mightier. It helps us become like champions who can handle even bigger challenges. Just like when I had tough times, they weren't fun, they weren’t easy, but they made me learn and become better. Each time something didn't go right, it was like a puzzle piece that helped my mind grow. Grit is like magic that makes us keep changing and getting better all the time.
</p>

<h5>			       <b> CONCLUSION: EMBRACING THE GROWTH MINDSET</b></h5>

<p>
The world is full of stories of individuals who defied the odds through sheer grit. My own journey is a testament to this. Faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges, I found solace in the unwavering power of grit. It's that late-night study session before a crucial exam, the extra mile put into refining a skill, and the determination to rise after a fall that makes all the difference. Grit doesn't just enhance the likelihood of success; it reshapes the narrative of our lives.
</p>

<p>
In a world that celebrates quick fixes and instant gratification, grit stands as a beacon of unwavering resolve. It's a mindset that not only propels us towards success but also ensures that success endures the test of time. As you embark on your own journey, remember that talent might be a head start, but grit is the marathon's finish line. Let your experiences shape you, failures fuel you, and grit guide you. Embrace the concept, value, and unparalleled importance of grit, and watch as your path to success transforms into an unbreakable voyage of triumph.<em> <strong>EMBRACE GRIT NOW!</strong></em>
